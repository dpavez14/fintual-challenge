# Challenge statement:

Construct a simple Portfolio class that has a collection of Stocks and a "Profit" method that receives 2 dates and returns the profit of the Portfolio between those dates. Assume each Stock has a "Price" method that receives a date and returns its price.
Bonus Track: make the Profit method return the "annualized return" of the portfolio between the given dates.

## Notes:

- Languages: C# 10 (dotnet 6.0) and Python 3.9.
- The unit tests were added to be able to test the implementation without add extra logic like a main method in and external class or something similar.
- If you aren't able to run the test, you can check the code_coverage HTML provided in each project to see the results of the last run.
- Unit test C#: xUnit. Code coverage generated on Rider.
- Unit test Python: unittest. Code coverage generated with coverage.py.
